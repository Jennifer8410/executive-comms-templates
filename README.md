# Executive Comms Templates (CEOs + Leadership)

Practical, plug-and-play templates for clear executive communication—internal updates, external statements, and leadership messaging.

## What’s inside
- Company announcement templates (internal + external)
- CEO LinkedIn post frameworks
- Press quote builder + talking points outlines
- Crisis “holding statement” structure (general, non-legal)

## How to use
Copy a template, fill in the brackets, and tailor the tone to your audience (employees, customers, investors, press).

## Note
These are general templates and not legal advice. For sensitive situations, align with counsel and PR leads.
